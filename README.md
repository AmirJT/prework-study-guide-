## Description

- I created this website to gain a better understanding of the differences between HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- For me, this was important because I had never coded before. This project has helped me understand how to start coding and how to progress to the point of running a website‚Äîfrom structuring it to maintaining and publishing it.
- In my opinion, this project can help solve the issue of starting from scratch. Once the classes begin, we will all have a basic understanding of how most things work, particularly using GitHub and how to collaborate through it. 
- There are many things I have learned in this prework study guide, but if I had to highlight the most important ones, I would say learning how to create SSH keys and work with GitHub, where to start coding, and how to do it. By this, I mean understanding what is being asked of me and developing a plan to execute it efficiently.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide helps you learn the basics of web development with notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. You can open the DevTools console to see JavaScript running, which lists the topics and suggests which one to study first. It‚Äôs a simple way to get started and understand how these tools work together.
